## Kuroro DLL Injector

### Usage

Just select the `seiya.exe` file you want to modify and the DLL you want to add as a dependency. After injecting, the executable will require the DLL in the same folder to start, and the DLL implementation will run right after the binary starts.

Take a look at [kuroro-sds-dll](https://github.com/kuroro7/kuroro-sds-dll) repository to some samples of useful things that can be done with dependency injection in `seiya.exe` file.
